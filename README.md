# Information-Extraction-System

This IE system processes articles related to attacks and finds out the type of attack (attack, kidnapping, robbery, arson, bombing), weapons used, perpetrators, victims and target.

The 'all_text.txt' contains all the articles and 'all_answers.txt' contains the right answer.
